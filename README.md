# Court-Judgement-Prediction-System
AI system for Romanian legal decision prediction using LLMs and automated web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium). Built data collection pipeline scraping legal documents from Romanian courts with VPN automation. Implemented BERT-based models for Romanian legal text analysis and case outcome prediction.

The project involved:
1. Familiarization with XAI (Explainable AI) and LLM (Large Language Model) arihtectures, such as GPT-4, LegalBERT, jurBERT.
2. Data Collection through an automated web scraping pipeline for extraction of romanian court decisions.
3. Model Development, by evaluation and adaptation of LLms for Romanian legal text classification, summarization, and outcome-prediction.
4. Model Optimization, where performance was improved via comparative analysis of techniques for model fine-tuning, in the context of legal prediction tasks
